[Live Preview](https://luhook04.github.io/memory-card/)

This app is a Pokémon memory game. The point of the game is to click every pokemon without clicking the same one twice. I built this app to practice using React Hooks and to get more comfortable with state and the useEffect Hook. One great feature, is that it updates with new Pokémon for every new visit to the site, or everytime the user hits "play again".
